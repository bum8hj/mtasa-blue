DLL files can be found in "Shared/data/MTA San Andreas/server".
That directory gets copied to the "Bin" directory when you run "win-install-data.bat".

The source code for MySQL and OpenSSL used to produce the binaries can be found here:
https://github.com/mysql/mysql-server/releases/tag/mysql-8.3.0
https://github.com/openssl/openssl/releases/tag/openssl-3.2.1

Apply the "mysql-server.diff" prior to building the mysql-server source code.
You must use the "build-x86", "build-x64", "build-arm64" subfolder names (e.g. mysql-server/build-x64),
because otherwise the patch won't work for cross-compiling ARM64 architecture.
